CodeMarshal - Truth-Preserving Investigation Environment

A detective's notebook for complex codebases. Investigate, understand,
and maintain architectural integrity without ever lying to you.

CodeMarshal follows 24 constitutional articles to ensure truth preservation,
human primacy, and explicit limitations. Every observation is immutable,
every claim is anchored to evidence, and every limitation is declared.

Version: 2.1.0

Constitutional Foundation:
    - Article 1: Truth Preservation (observations are immutable)
    - Article 2: Human Primacy (humans initiate all actions)
    - Article 7: Clear Affordances (no hidden capabilities)
    - Article 19: Backward Truth Compatibility (exports preserve truth)

Quick Start:
    >>> import codemarshal
    >>> codemarshal.__version__
    '2.1.0'

For detailed documentation, see README.md and ROADMAP.md
