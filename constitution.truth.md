# CodeMarshal Constitution of Truth

## TIER 1: Foundational Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### Article 1: Observation Purity
Observations record only what is textually present in source code. No inference, no guessing, no interpretation. Observations are immutable once recorded.

### Article 2: Human Primacy
Humans ask questions, see patterns, and think thoughts. The system provides observations, detects anomalies, and preserves thinking. Never reverse these roles.

### Article 3: Truth Preservation
The system must never obscure, distort, or invent information. When truth is uncertain, show uncertainty clearly (⚠️). When truth is unknown, say "I cannot see this."

### Article 4: Progressive Disclosure
Start with simple observations, reveal complexity only when requested. Never overwhelm with information. Each interaction should answer exactly one human question.

### Article 5: Interface Purity
The interface must make reality clearer, not obscure it.

### Article 6: Layer Separation
Strict import boundaries between architectural layers must be enforced.
